# OpenSea NFT Explorer

**Update: This project was using OpenSea API v1.0 but it is no longer stable so this project is no longer being updated and is not available for preview.**

A website where you can explore NFT's from OpenSea - the world's first and largest NFT marketplace.

This website uses [OpenSea's](https://opensea.io) API to fetch and display information about assets (NFTs) sorted by various filters in an on-demand fetched list of presumably never ending supply of new data (unless you're willing to scroll through millions of assets). The website also provides the ability to view details about each asset in a dynamically rendered asset page with detailed information fetched, you guessed it - on demand!
